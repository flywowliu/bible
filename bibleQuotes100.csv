8,"8.加Gal 2:20 我已经与基督同钉十字架，现在活著的不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活著；并且我如今在肉身活著，是因信神的儿子而活，他是爱我，为我舍己。I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
9,"9.弗Eph 2:8-9 你们得救是本乎恩，也因著信。这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的； For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God<br>也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。: not by works, so that no one can boast."
10,"10.林后2 Cor 12:9 他对我说：“我的恩典够你用的，因为我的能力是在人的软弱上显得完全。”所以，我更喜欢夸自己的软弱，好叫基督的能力覆庇我。But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me."

84,"84.提后2 Tim 1:7 因为神赐给我们不是胆怯的心，乃是刚强、仁爱、谨守的心。 For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline."
85,"85.提后2 Tim 3:16-17 圣经都是神所默示的，于教训、督责、使人归正、教导人学义都是有益的， All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,<br>叫属神的人得以完全，预备行各样的善事。 so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."
86,"86.来Heb 4:12 神的道是活泼的，是有功效的，比一切两刃的剑更快，甚至魂与灵、骨节与骨髓，都能刺入、剖开，连心中的思念和主意都能辨明。 For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."
87,"87.来Heb 4:15-16 因我们的大祭司并非不能体恤我们的软弱，他也曾凡事受过试探，与我们一样；只是他没有犯罪。 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin.<br>所以我们只管坦然无惧地来到施恩的宝座前，为要得怜恤，蒙恩惠，作随时的帮助。 Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need."
88,"88.来Heb 10:25 你们不可停止聚会，好像那些停止惯了的人，倒要彼此劝勉。既知道那日子临近，就更当如此。 Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching."
89,89.来Heb 11:1 信就是所望之事的实底，是未见之事的确据。 Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.
90,"90.来Heb 11:6 人非有信，就不能得　神的喜悦；因为到神面前来的人，必须信有神，且信他赏赐那寻求他的人。 And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."
91,"91.来Heb 12:1-2 我们既有这许多的见证人，如同云彩围著我们，就当放下各样的重担，脱去容易缠累我们的罪，存心忍耐，奔那摆在我们前头的路程: Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.<br>仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣。他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在神宝座的右边。 Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
92,"92.来Heb 13:5 你们存心不可贪爱钱财，要以自己所有的为足。因为主曾说：“我总不撇下你，也不丢弃你。” Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, “Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.”"
93,"93.雅Jas 1:2-4 我的弟兄们，你们落在百般试炼中，都要以为大喜乐； Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds,<br>因为知道你们的信心经过试验，就生忍耐。 because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.<br>但忍耐也当成功，使你们成全完备，毫无缺欠。 Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."
94,"94.雅Jas 1:12 忍受试探的人是有福的，因为他经过试验以后，必得生命的冠冕，这是主应许给那些爱他之人的。 Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him."
95,95.雅Jas 5:16 所以你们要彼此认罪，互相代求，使你们可以得医治。义人祈祷所发的力量是大有功效的。 Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.
96,"96.彼前1 Pet 3:15 只要心里尊主基督为圣。有人问你们心中盼望的缘由，就要常作准备，以温柔、敬畏的心回答各人。 But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,"
97,97.彼前1 Pet 5:7-8 你们要将一切的忧虑卸给神，因为他顾念你们。 Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.<br>务要谨守，儆醒。因为你们的仇敌魔鬼，如同吼叫的狮子，遍地游行，寻找可吞吃的人。 Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
98,"98.约一1 John 1:9 我们若认自己的罪，神是信实的，是公义的，必要赦免我们的罪，洗净我们一切的不义； <br>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."
99,"99.约一1 John 2:15-16 不要爱世界和世界上的事。人若爱世界，爱父的心就不在他里面了。<br>Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<br>因为凡世界上的事，就像肉体的情欲，眼目的情欲，并今生的骄傲，都不是从父来的，乃是从世界来的。For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world."
100,"100.启Rev 21:6 “...我是阿拉法，我是俄梅戛；我是初，我是终。 我要将生命泉的水白白赐给那口渴的人喝。” <br>... I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life."
