271,"287 因为神的义正在这福音上显明出来；这义是本于信，以致于信。如经上所记：“义人必因信得生。” (罗 1:17)<br>For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: ""The righteous will live by faith."""
272,"288 自从造天地以来，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但藉着所造之物就可以晓得，叫人无可推诿。(罗 1:20)<br>For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse."
273,"289 凡没有律法犯了罪的，也必不按律法灭亡；凡在律法以下犯了罪的，也必按律法受审判。(罗 2:12)<br>All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law."
274,"290 所以凡有血气的，没有一个因行律法能在神面前称义，因为律法本是叫人知罪。(罗 3:20)<br>Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin. (Righteousness Through Faith )"
275,"291 因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀；如今却蒙神的恩典，因基督耶稣的救赎，就白白地称义。(罗 3:23-24)<br>For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus."
276,"293 神设立耶稣作挽回祭，是凭着耶稣的血，藉着人的信，要显明神的义。因为他用忍耐的心，宽容人先时所犯的罪。(罗 3:25)<br>God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished--"
277,"294 我们既因信称义，就藉着我们的主耶稣基督得与神相和。(罗 5:1)<br>Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
278,"295 惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。(罗 5:8)<br>But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
279,"296 这就如罪是从一人入了世界，死又是从罪来的，于是死就临到众人，因为众人都犯了罪。(罗 5:12)<br>Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--"
280,297 岂不知我们这受洗归入基督耶稣的人，是受洗归入他的死么？ (罗 6:3)<br>Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
281,"298 所以我们藉着洗礼归入死，和他一同埋葬，原是叫我们一举一动有新生的样式，像基督藉着父的荣耀从死里复活一样。(罗 6:4)<br>We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."
282,"299 因为罪的工价乃是死；惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。(罗 6:23)<br>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
283,"300 我也知道在我里头，就是我肉体之中，没有良善。因为立志为善由得我，只是行出来由不得我。(罗 7:18)<br>I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out."
284,301 因为赐生命的圣灵的律在基督耶稣里释放了我，使我脱离罪和死的律了。(罗 8:2)<br>Because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.
285,"302 体贴肉体的就是死；体贴圣灵的乃是生命平安。(罗 8:6)<br>The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace;"
286,303 我想，现在的苦楚若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀，就不足介意了。(罗 8:18)<br>I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
287,"304 况且，我们的软弱有圣灵帮助，我们本不晓得当怎样祷告，只是圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息替我们祷告。(罗 8:26)<br>In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express."
288,"305 我们晓得万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，就是按他旨意被召的人。(罗 8:28)<br>And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."
289,"306 神既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？(罗 8:32)<br>He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?"
290,307 谁能使我们与基督的爱隔绝呢？难道是患难吗？是困苦吗？是逼迫吗？是饥饿吗？是赤身露体吗？是危险吗？是刀剑吗？(罗 8:35)<br>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
291,"308 然而，靠着我们的主，在这一切的事上已经得胜有余了。(罗 8:37)<br>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us."
292,309 律法的总结就是基督，使凡信他的都得着义。(罗 10:4)<br>Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
293,"310 你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫他从死里复活，就必得救。(罗 10:9)<br>That if you confess with your mouth, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
294,"311 可见信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。(罗 10:17)<br>Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ."
295,"312 所以弟兄们，我以神的慈悲劝你们，将身体献上，当作活祭，是圣洁的，是神所喜悦的；你们如此侍奉，乃是理所当然的。(罗 12:1)<br>Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God--this is your spiritual act of worship."
296,"313 不要效法这个世界，只要心意更新而变化，叫你们察验何为神的善良、纯全、可喜悦的旨意。(罗 12:2)<br>Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will."
297,"314 在指望中要喜乐，在患难中要忍耐；祷告要恒切。(罗 12:12)<br>Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer."
298,315 不要以恶报恶。众人以为美的事，要留心去做。(罗 12:17)<br>Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody.
299,"316 亲爱的弟兄，不要自己伸冤，宁可让步，听凭主怒。因为经上记着：“主说：伸冤在我，我必报应。”(罗 12:19)<br>Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: ""It is mine to avenge; I will repay,"" says the Lord."
300,"317 凡事都不可亏欠人，惟有彼此相爱，要常以为亏欠，因为爱人的就完全了律法。(罗 13:8)<br>Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law."
301,"318 总要披戴主耶稣基督，不要为肉体安排去放纵私欲。(罗 13:14)<br>Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature."
302,"319 我们若活着，是为主而活；若死了，是为主而死。所以我们或活或死，总是主的人。(罗 14:8)<br>If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord."
303,"320 因为神的国不在乎吃喝，只在乎公义、和平并圣灵中的喜乐。(罗 14:17)<br>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."
304,"321 但愿使人有盼望的神，因信将诸般的喜乐平安充满你们的心，使你们藉着圣灵的能力大有盼望。(罗 15:13)<br>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit."
305,"322 因为十字架的道理，在那灭亡的人为愚拙；在我们得救的人却为神的大能。(林前 1:18)<br>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."
306,"323 如经上所记：“神为爱他的人所预备的，是眼睛未曾看见，耳朵未曾听见，人心也未曾想到的。”只有神藉着圣灵向我们显明了，因为圣灵参透万事，就是神深奥的事也参透了。(林前 2:9-10)<br>However, as it is written: ""No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him"" --but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit."
307,325 岂不知你们是神的殿，神的灵住在你们里头么？ (林前 3:16)<br>Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?
308,326 因为你们是重价买来的，所以要在你们的身子荣耀神。(林前 6:20)<br>You were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.
309,"327 但知识是叫人自高自大，惟有爱心能造就人。(林前 8:1下)<br>Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."
310,"328 我传福音原没有可夸的。因为我是不得已的；若不传福音，我便有祸了。(林前 9:16)<br>Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, for I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!"
311,"329 向软弱的人，我就作软弱的人，为要得软弱的人；向什么样的人，我就作什么样的人。无论如何，总要救些人。(林前 9:22)<br>To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some."
312,"330 凡我所行的，都是为福音的缘故，为要与人同得这福音的好处。(林前 9:23)<br>I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings."
313,"331 我是攻克己身，叫身服我，恐怕我传福音给别人，自己反被弃绝了。(林前 9:27)<br>No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize."
314,"332 你们所遇见的试探，无非是人所能受的。神是信实的，必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的。在受试探的时候，总要给你们开一条出路，叫你们能忍受得住。(林前 10:13)<br>No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it."
315,"333 凡事都可行，但不都有益处。凡事都可行，但不都造就人。(林前 10:23)<br>""Everything is permissible""--but not everything is beneficial. ""Everything is permissible""--but not everything is constructive."
316,"334 祝谢了，就擘开，说：“这是我的身体，为你们舍的。你们应当如此行，为的是记念我。” (林前 11:24)<br>When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, ""This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me."""
317,"335 饭后，也照样拿起杯 来，说：“这杯是用我的血所立的新约。你们每逢喝的时候，要如此行，为的是记念我。”(林前 11:25)<br>In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, ""This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."""
318,"336 若一个肢体受苦，所有的肢体就一同受苦；若一个肢体得荣耀，所有的肢体就一同快乐。(林前 12:26)<br>If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it."
319,"337 我若将所有的周济穷人，又舍己身叫人焚烧，却没有爱，仍然与我无益。(林前 13:3)<br>If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing."
320,"338 爱是恒久忍耐，又有恩慈；爱是不嫉妒，爱是不自夸，不张狂。(林前 13:4)<br>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud."
321,"339 不做害羞的事，不求自己的益处，不轻易发怒，不计算人的恶。(林前 13:5)<br>It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs."
322,340 不喜欢不义，只喜欢真理。(林前 13:6)<br>Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
323,"341 凡事包容，凡事相信，凡事盼望，凡事忍耐。(林前 13:7)<br>It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."
324,342 爱是永不止息。(林前 13:8上)<br>Love never fails.
325,"343 如今常存的有信，有望，有爱；这三样，其中最大的是爱。(林前 13:13)<br>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."
326,"344 你们要追求爱，也要切慕属灵的恩赐，其中更要羡慕的，是作先知讲道。(林前 14:1)<br>Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy."
327,"345 若基督没有复活，我们所传的便是枉然，你们所信的也是枉然！(林前 15:14)<br>And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith."
328,"346 在亚当里众人都死了；照样，在基督里众人也都要复活。(林前 15:22)<br>For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."
329,"347 所以，我亲爱的弟兄们，你们务要坚固，不可摇动，常常竭力多做主工，因为知道你们的劳苦，在主里面不是徒然的。(林前 15:58)<br>Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain."
330,348 凡你们所做的，都要凭爱心而做。(林前 16:14)<br>Do everything in love.
331,"349 我们在一切患难中，他就安慰我们，叫我们能用神所赐的安慰去安慰那遭各样患难的人。(林后 1:4)<br>Who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God."
332,"350 感谢神！常率领我们在基督里夸胜，并藉着我们在各处显扬那因认识基督而有的香气。(林后 2:14)<br>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him."
333,"351 他叫我们能承当这新约的执事，不是凭着字句，乃是凭着精意。因为那字句是叫人死，精意是叫人活。(林后 3:6)<br>He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."
334,352 我们有这宝贝放在瓦器里，要显明这莫大的力，是出于神，不是出于我们。(林后 4:7)<br>But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.
335,"353 所以，我们不丧胆。外体虽然毁坏，内心却一天新似一天。(林后 4:16)<br>Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day."
336,354 我们这至暂至轻的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比永远的荣耀。(林后 4:17)<br>For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
337,"355 原来我们不是顾念所见的，乃是顾念所不见的；因为所见的是暂时的，所不见的是永远的。(林后 4:18)<br>So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."
338,"356 因我们行事为人是凭着信心，不是凭着眼见。(林后 5:7)<br>We live by faith, not by sight."
339,"357 所以无论是住在身内，离开身外，我们立了志向，要得主的喜悦。(林后 5:9)<br>So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it."
340,"358 原来基督的爱激励我们。因我们想一人既替众人死，众人就都死了。(林后 5:14)<br>For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died."
341,"359 并且他替众人死，是叫那些活着的人不再为自己活，乃为替他们死而复活的主活。(林后 5:15)<br>And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again."
342,"360 若有人在基督里，他就是新造的人，旧事已过，都变成新的了。(林后 5:17)<br>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!"
343,"361 所以我们作基督的使者，就好像神藉我们劝你们一般。我们替基督求你们与神和好。(林后 5:20)<br>We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God."
344,"362 神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。(林后 5:21)<br>God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
345,363 你们和不信的原不相配，不要同负一轭。义和不义有什么相交呢？光明和黑暗有什么相通呢？ (林后 6:14)<br>Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?
346,"364 你们知道我们主耶稣基督的恩典：他本来富足，却为你们成了贫穷，叫你们因他的贫穷，可以成为富足。(林后 8:9)<br>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich."
347,"365 各人要随本心所酌定的，不要作难，不要勉强，因为捐得乐意的人是神所喜爱的。(林后 9:7)<br>Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."
348,"366 他对我说：“我的恩典够你用的，因为我的能力，是在人的软弱上显得完全。” 所以，我更喜欢夸自己的软弱，好叫基督的能力覆庇我。(林后 12:9)<br>But he said to me, ""My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."" Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me."
349,"367 我已经与基督同钉十字架，现在活着的不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活着；并且我如今在肉身活着，是因信神的儿子而活，他是爱我，为我舍己。(加 2:20)<br>I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
350,"368 圣灵所结的果子，就是仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、恩慈、良善、信实、温柔、节制。这样的事，没有律法禁止。(加 5:22-23)<br>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law."
351,"370 弟兄们，若有人偶然被过犯所胜，你们属灵的人，就应当用温柔的心，把他挽回过来；又当自己小心，恐怕也被引诱。(加 6:1)<br>Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted."
352,"371 我们行善，不可丧志；若不灰心，到了时候就要收成。(加 6:9)<br>Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up."
353,"372 但我断不以别的夸口，只夸我们主耶稣基督的十字架。因这十字架，就我而论，世界已经钉在十字架上；就世界而论，我已经钉在十字架上。(加 6:14)<br>May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world."
354,"373 求我们主耶稣基督的神，荣耀的父，将那赐人智慧和启示的灵赏给你们，使你们真知道他。(弗 1:17)<br>I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know Him better."
355,"374 你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信。这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。(弗 2:8-9)<br>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-not by works, so that no one can boast."
356,"376 我们原是他的工作，在基督耶稣里造成的，为要叫我们行善，就是神所预备叫我们行的。(弗 2:10)<br>For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."
357,"377 叫你们的爱心有根有基，能以和众圣徒一同明白基督的爱是何等长阔高深！并且知道这爱是过于人所能测度的，便叫神一切所充满的，充满了你们。(弗 3:17下-19)<br>And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God."
358,"380 凡事谦虚、温柔、忍耐，用爱心互相宽容。(弗 4:2)<br>Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love."
359,381 用和平彼此联络，竭力保守圣灵所赐合而为一的心。(弗 4:3)<br>Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
360,"382 惟用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督。(弗 4:15)<br>Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ."
361,"383 生气却不要犯罪，不可含怒到日落；也不可给魔鬼留地步。(弗 4:26-27)<br>""In your anger do not sin"": Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold."
362,"385 污秽的言语，一句不可出口，只要随事说造就人的好话，叫听见的人得益处。(弗 4:29)<br>Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen."
363,"386 当用诗章、颂词、灵歌彼此对说，口唱心和地赞美主。(弗 5:19)<br>Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,"
364,387 又当存敬畏基督的心，彼此顺服。(弗 5:21)<br>Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
365,"388 你们作妻子的，当顺服自己的丈夫，如同顺服主。(弗 5:22)<br>Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord."
366,"389 你们作丈夫的，要爱你们的妻子，正如基督爱教会，为教会舍己。(弗 5:25)<br>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her"
367,"390 你们作儿女的，要在主里听从父母，这是理所当然的。(弗 6:1)<br>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."
368,"391 要孝敬父母，使你们得福，在世长寿。这是第一条带应许的诫命。(弗 6:2-3)<br>""Honor your father and mother""--which is the first commandment with a promise--""that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth."""
369,"393 你们作父亲的，不要惹儿女的气，只要照着主的教训和警戒养育他们。(弗 6:4)<br>Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord."
370,394 要穿戴神所赐的全副军装，就能抵挡魔鬼的诡计。(弗 6:11)<br>Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
371,"395 所以要站稳了，用真理当作带子束腰，用公义当作护心镜遮胸，又用平安的福音当作预 备走路的鞋穿在脚上。(弗 6:14-15)<br>Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace."
372,"397 此外，又拿着信德当作藤牌，可以灭尽那恶者一切的火箭。(弗 6:16)<br>In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one."
373,"398 并戴上救恩的头盔，拿着圣灵的宝剑 ，就是神的道。(弗 6:17)<br>Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."
374,"399 照着我所切慕、所盼望的，没有一事叫我羞愧。只要凡事放胆，无论是生是死，总叫基督在我身上照常显大。(腓 1:20)<br>I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death."
375,"400 因我活着就是基督，我死了就有益处。(腓 1:21)<br>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain."
376,"401 凡事不可结党，不可贪图虚浮的荣耀；只要存心谦卑，各人看别人比自己强。(腓 2:3)<br>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves."
377,402 你们当以基督耶稣的心为心。(腓 2:5)<br>Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:
378,"403 他本有神的形像，不以自己与神同等为强夺的，反倒虚己，取了奴仆的形像，成为人的样式。(腓 2:6-7)<br>Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness."
379,"405 既有人的样子，就自己卑微，存心顺服，以至于死，且死在十字架上。(腓 2:8)<br>And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death-even death on a cross!"
380,"406 所以神将他升为至高，又赐给他那超乎万名之上的名，叫一切在天上的、地上的和地底下的，因耶稣的名无不屈膝，无不口称耶稣基督为主，使荣耀归与父神。(腓 2:9-11)<br>Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
381,"409 不但如此，我也将万事都当有损的，因我以认识我主基督耶稣为至宝。(腓 3:8)<br>What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."
382,"410 弟兄们，我不是以为自己已经得着了，我只有一件事，就是忘记背后，努力面前的。(腓 3:13)<br>Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,"
383,411 向着标竿直跑，要得神 在基督耶稣里从上面召我来得的奖赏。(腓 3:14)<br>I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
384,"412 我们却是天上的国民，并且等候救主，就是主耶稣基督从天上降临。(腓 3:20)<br>But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,"
385,413 你们要靠主常常喜乐！我再说，你们要喜乐！(腓 4:4)<br>Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!
386,"414 应当一无挂虑，只要凡事藉着祷告、祈求和感谢，将你们所要的告诉神。(腓 4:6)<br>Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God."
387,"415 神所赐出人意外的平安，必在基督耶稣里，保守你们的心怀意念。(腓 4:7)<br>And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."
388,"416 弟兄们，我还有未尽的话：凡是真实的、可敬的、公义的、清洁的、可爱的、有美名的，若有什么德行，若有什么称赞，这些事你们都要思念。(腓 4:8)<br>Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things."
389,"417 我知道怎样处卑贱，也知道怎样处丰富，或饱足、或饥饿、或有余、或缺乏，随事随在，我都得了秘诀。(腓 4:12)<br>I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want."
390,418 我靠着那加给我力量的，凡事都能做。(腓 4:13)<br>I can do everything through him who gives me strength.
391,"419 爱子是那不能看见之神的像，是首生的，在一切被造的以先。(西 1:15)<br>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation."
392,"420 他也是教会全体之首，他是元始，是从死里首先复生的，使他可以在凡事上居首位。(西 1:18)<br>And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy."
393,"421 你们要思念上面的事，不要思念地上的事。(西 3:2)<br>Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things."
394,"422 当用各样的智慧，把基督的道理丰丰富富地存在心里，用诗章、颂词、灵歌、彼此教导，互相劝戒，心被恩感，歌颂神。(西 3:16)<br>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God."
395,"423 无论做什么，都要从心里做，像是给主做的，不是给人做的。(西 3:23)<br>Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men."
396,"424 以后我们这活着还存留的人必和他们一同被提到云里，在空中与主相遇。这样，我们就要和主永远同在。(帖前 4:17)<br>After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever."
397,"425 要常常喜乐，不住地祷告，凡事谢恩，因为这是神在基督耶稣里向你们所定的旨意。(帖前 5:16-18)<br>Be joyful always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
398,"428 但命令总归就是爱，这爱是从清洁的心和无亏的良心、无伪的信心生出来的。(提前 1:5)<br>The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith."
399,429 “基督耶稣降世，为要拯救罪人。”这话是可信的，是十分可佩服的。在罪人中我是个罪魁。(提前 1:15)<br>Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners--of whom I am the worst.
400,"430 操练身体，益处还少；惟独敬虔，凡事都有益处，因有今生和来生的应许。(提前 4:8)<br>For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come."
401,"431 不可叫人小看你年轻，总要在言语、行为、爱心、信心、清洁上，都作信徒的榜样。(提前 4:12)<br>Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity."
402,"432 因为我们没有带什么到世上来，也不能带什么去。只要有衣有食，就当知足。(提前 6:7-8)<br>For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that."
403,"434 贪财是万恶之根！有人贪恋钱财，就被引诱离了真道，用许多愁苦把自己刺透了。(提前 6:10)<br>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."
404,"435 因为神赐给我们不是胆怯的心，乃是刚强、仁爱、谨守的心。(提后 1:7)<br>For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline."
405,"436 为这缘故，我也受这些苦难，然而我不以为耻。因为我知道我所信的是谁，也深信他能保全我所交付他的，直到那日。(提后 1:12)<br>That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day."
406,437 你在许多见证人面前听见我所教训的，也要交托那忠心能教导别人的人。(提后 2:2)<br>And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.
407,"438 “我们纵然失信，他仍是可信的，因为他不能背乎自己。” (提后 2:13)<br>If we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself."
408,"439 你当竭力在神面前得蒙喜悦，作无愧的工人，按着正意分解真理的道。(提后 2:15)<br>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth."
409,"440 人若自洁，脱离卑贱的事，就必作贵重的器皿，成为圣洁，合乎主用，预备行各样的善事。(提后 2:21)<br>If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work."
410,"441 圣经都是神所默示的，于教训、督责、使人归正、教导人学义都是有益的，叫属神的人得以完全，预备行各样的善事。(提后 3:16-17)<br>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."
411,"443 务要传道！无论得时不得时，总要专心，并用百般的忍耐，各样的教训，责备人，警戒人，劝勉人。(提后 4:2)<br>Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction."
412,"444 那美好的仗我已经打过了，当跑的路我已经跑尽了，所信的道我已经守住了。(提后 4:7)<br>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith."
413,"445 从此以后，有公义的冠冕为我存留，就是按着公义审判的主到了那日要赐给我的；不但赐给我，也赐给凡爱慕他显现的人。(提后 4:8)<br>Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing."
414,"446 你要提醒众人，叫他们顺服作官的、掌权的，遵他的命，预备行各样的善事。(多 3:1)<br>Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good,"
415,"447 他是神荣耀所发的光辉，是神本体的真像，常用他权能的命令托住万有，他洗净了人的罪，就坐在高天至大者的右边。(来 1:3)<br>The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven."
416,"448 我们若忽略这么大的救恩，怎能逃罪呢。这救恩起先主亲自讲的，后来是听见的人给我们证实了。(来 2:3)<br>How shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him."
417,"449 神的道是活泼的，是有功效的，比一切两刃的剑更快，甚至魂与灵，骨节与骨髓，都能刺入剖开，连心中的思念和主意，都能辨明。(来 4:12)<br>For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."
418,"450 因我们的大祭司，并非不能体恤我们的软弱。他也曾凡事受过试探，与我们一样。只是他没有犯罪。(来 4:15)<br>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin."
419,"451 所以我们只管坦然无惧地来到施恩的宝座前，为要得怜恤，蒙恩惠作随时的帮助。(来 4:16)<br>Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need."
420,"452 按着定命，人人都有一死，死后且有审判。(来 9:27)<br>Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,"
421,"453 弟兄们，我们既因耶稣的血，得以坦然进入至圣所，是藉着他给我们开了一条又新又活的路从幔子经过，这幔子就是他的身体。(来 10:19-20)<br>Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body,"
422,"455 你们不可停止聚会，好像那些停止惯了的人，倒要彼此劝勉。既知道那日子临近，就更当如此。(来 10:25)<br>Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching."
423,456 信就是所望之事的实底，是未见之事的确据。(来 11:1)<br>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.
424,"457 人非有信就不能得神的喜悦。因为到神面前来的人，必须信有神，且信他赏赐那寻求他的人。(来 11:6)<br>And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."
425,"458 我们既有这许多的见证人，如同云彩围着我们，就当放下各样的重担 ，脱去容易缠累我们的罪，存心忍耐，奔那摆在我们前头的路程。(来 12:1)<br>Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us."
426,"459 仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣。他因那摆在前头的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在神宝座的右边。(来 12:2)<br>Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
427,"460 生身的父都是暂随己意管教我们，惟有万灵的父管教我们，是要我们得益处，使我们在他的圣洁上有分。(来 12:10)<br>Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness."
428,"461 凡管教的事，当时不觉得快乐，反觉得愁苦，后来却为那经炼过的人结出平安的果子，就是义。(来 12:11)<br>No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it."
429,"462我的弟兄们，你们落在百般试炼中，都要以为大喜乐；因为知道你们的信心经过试验，就生忍耐。但忍耐也当成功，使你们成全完备，毫无缺欠。(雅 1:2-4)<br>Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."
430,"463你们中间若有缺少智慧的，应当求那厚赐与众人、也不斥责人的神，主就必赐给他。只要凭着信心求，一点不疑惑；因为那疑惑的人，就像海中的波浪，被风吹动翻腾。这样的人不要想从主那里得甚麽。心怀二意的人，在他一切所行的路上都没有定见。(雅 1:5-8)<br>If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do."
431,"464 忍受试探的人是有福的，因为他经过试验以后，必得生命的冠冕，这是主应许给那些爱他之人的。(雅 1:12)<br>Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him."
432,"465 我亲爱的弟兄们，这是你们所知道的。但你们各人要快快地听，慢慢地说，慢慢地动怒。(雅 1:19)<br>My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,"
433,"466 只是你们要行道，不要单单听道，自己欺哄自己。(雅 1:22)<br>Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says."
434,"467 身体没有灵魂是死的，信心没有行为也是死的。(雅 2:26)<br>If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless."
435,"468 原来我们在许多事上都有过失；若有人在话语上没有过失，他就是完全人，也能勒住自己的全身。(雅 3:2)<br>We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to keep his whole body in check."
436,"469 故此，你们要顺服神。务要抵挡魔鬼，魔鬼就必离开你们逃跑了。(雅 4:7)<br>Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
437,"470 其实明天如何，你们还不知道。你们的生命是什么呢？你们原来是一片云雾，出现少时就不见了。(雅 4:14)<br>Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes."
438,471 所以你们要彼此认罪，互相代求，使你们可以得医治。义人祈祷所发的力量是大有功效的。(雅 5:16)<br>Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.
439,"472 惟有你们是被拣选的族类，是有君尊的祭司，是圣洁的国度，是属神的子民，要叫你们宣扬那召你们出黑暗入奇妙光明者的美德。(彼前 2:9)<br>But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light."
440,"473 只要心里尊主基督为圣。有人问你们心中盼望的缘由，就要常作准备，以温柔敬畏的心回答各人。(彼前 3:15)<br>But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,"
441,"474 最要紧的是彼此切实相爱。因为爱能遮掩许多的罪。(彼前 4:8)<br>Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins."
442,475 你们要将一切的忧虑卸给神，因为他顾念你们。(彼前 5:7)<br>Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
443,476 务要谨守，儆醒。因为你们的仇敌魔鬼，如同吼叫的狮子，遍地游行，寻找可吞吃的人。(彼前 5:8)<br>Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
444,"477 亲爱的弟兄啊，有一件事你们不可忘记，就是主看一日如千年，千年如一日。(彼后 3:8)<br>But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day."
445,"478 主所应许的尚未成就，有人以为他是耽延，其实不是耽延，乃是宽容你们，不愿有一人沉沦，乃愿人人都悔改。(彼后 3:9)<br>The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."
446,"479 我们若认自己的罪，神是信实的，是公义的，必要赦免我们的罪，洗净我们一切的不义。(约壹 1:9)<br>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."
447,"480 不要爱世界和世界上的事。人若爱世界，爱父的心就不在他里面了。(约壹 2:15)<br>Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
448,"481 因为凡世界上的事，就像肉体的情欲，眼目的情欲，并今生的骄傲，都不是从父来的，乃是从世界来的。(约壹 2:16)<br>For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world."
449,"482 这世界和其上的情欲都要过去，惟独遵行神旨意的，是永远常存。(约壹 2:17)<br>The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever."
450,"483 凡从神生的，就不犯罪，因神的道存在他心里；他也不能犯罪，因为他是由神生的。(约壹 3:9)<br>No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God."
451,"484 小子们哪，我们相爱，不要只在言语和舌头上，总要在行为和诚实上。(约壹 3:18)<br>Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth."
452,"485 凡灵认耶稣基督是成了肉身来的，就是出于神的，从此你们可以认出神的灵来。(约壹 4:2)<br>This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,"
453,"486 没有爱心的，就不认识神，因为神就是爱。(约壹 4:8)<br>Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."
454,"487 不是我们爱神，乃是神爱我们，差他的儿子，为我们的罪作了挽回祭，这就是爱了。(约壹 4:10)<br>This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins."
455,"488 爱里没有惧怕；爱既完全，就把惧怕除去，因为惧怕里含着刑罚，惧怕的人在爱里未得完全。(约壹 4:18)<br>There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love."
456,489 我们爱，因为神先爱我们。(约壹 4:19)<br>We love because He first loved us.
457,"490 人若说“我爱神”，却恨他的弟兄，就是说谎话的；不爱他所看见的弟兄，就不能爱没有看见的神。(约壹 4:20)<br>If anyone says, ""I love God,"" yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen."
458,"491 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们却要在至圣的真道上造就自己，在圣灵里祷告。(犹 1:20)<br>But you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit."
459,492 然而有一件事我要责备你，就是你把起初的爱心离弃了。(启 2:4)<br>Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken your first love.
460,"493 所以应当回想你是从哪里坠落的，并要悔改，行起初所行的事。你若不悔改，我就临到你那里，把你的灯台从原处挪去。(启 2:5)<br>Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place."
461,"494 你务要至死忠心，我就赐给你那生命的冠冕。(启 2:10下)<br>Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life."
462,"495 凡得胜的，必这样穿白衣，我也必不从生命册上涂抹他的名；且要在我父面前，和我父众使者面前，认他的名。(启 3:5)<br>He who overcomes will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels."
463,"496 看哪！我站在门外叩门，若有听见我声音就开门的，我要进到他那里去，我与他，他与我一同坐席。(启 3:20)<br>Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me."
464,"497我又看见圣城新耶路撒冷由神那里从天而降，预备好了，就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫。(启 21:2)<br>I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband."
465,"498 我听见有大声音从宝座出来说：“看哪！神的帐幕在人间。他要与人同住，他们要作他的子民；神要亲自与他们同在，作他们的神。” (启 21:3)<br>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ""Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God."
466,"499 神要擦去他们一切的眼泪；不再有死亡，也不再有悲哀、 哭号、 疼痛，因为以前的事都过去了。(启 21:4)<br>He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."""
467,"500 他又对我说：“都成了。我是阿拉法，我是俄梅戛；我是初，我是终。我要将生命泉的水白白赐给那口渴的人喝。” (启 21:6)<br>He said to me: ""It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life."
